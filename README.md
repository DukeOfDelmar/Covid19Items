# DCEMS COVID 19 3D Printed PPE Files


These files were provided by Columbus Industries to Delaware County EMS to create masks to help ensure adequate PPE supply during the coming surge.

All files are provided as-is with no warranty or guarantee as to suitability for any purpose, including prevention of transmission of any disease. Use at your own risk.

When used with a thermoforming process to fit the mask, these masks have been found to pass a fit test for seal. Such testing before use is highly recommended.

Our current recommended print settings:
- Object Scale: 2540% (model was created in inches but most slicers want millimeters)
- Material: PLA (needs to be thermoformed to the wearer so requires PLA's properties of glass state transition at 60 degrees Celsius)
- Infill: 100% (Model is already designed with minimal infill volume)
- Walls/Perimeters: 5
- Top/Bottom Layers: 9
- Nozzle Width/Layer Height:
    * 0.4mm/0.2mm
    * 0.6mm/0.3mm
- Flow Rate/Overextrusion: 120% (to ensure good seal between print layers)

Recommended antiseptic procedures for producing:
- Wear a face mask whenever within 6 feet of the print area.
- Sanitize print bed and work area with bleach dilute or similar anti-viral disinfectant.
- Wash hands and wear disposable gloves before handling printer or printed parts.
- If possible print on clean glass without adhesive aids (may require heated print bed).
- Wipe down printed parts with bleach dilute or similar anti-viral disinfectant.
- Clean parts as soon as possible after print completes and immediately bag in a reclosable bag.

Helpful hints to allow tracking and recall (in case you get sick, find that materials were faulty, etc.)
- Collect all masks made in one day in a single bag.
- Label the bag with the packaging date.
- Label the contents of the bag as "Columbus Industries Mask".
- Label the bag with your name and the quantity of masks included.
