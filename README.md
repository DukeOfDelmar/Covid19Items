# MontanaMask
Original Montana Mask and Revisions Made Working with Delaware County District Library and  Delaware County EMS in Ohio.

We are fervently working on a 3D printed solution based on the design released by Billings Clinic Neurosurgeon, Dusty Richardson, MD, in collaboration with Billings-area dentist Spencer Zaugg, DDS and his son Colton. (https://www.billingsclinic.com/foundation/) 

Our current need is to have these masks be able to pass a fit test showing that they are allowing through no unfiltered air.

The revisions made thus far are as follows:

- MontanaMaskFilterFlanged.stl - Flanged version of the filter retainer to help provide better seal between filter and filter hole. (Experimental)
- MontanaMaskRibbed.stl - Montana Mask with triple ribbing along the face-to-mask interface to help provide a better seal. (Experimental)
